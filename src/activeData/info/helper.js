In additional to the professional development, Theta Tau has supported my ambitions to grow in my field of expertise and become more confident in working with stakeholders. Theta Tau was both a professional organization but also a second family where I can be myself around. ",

I aspire to have a stable job that uses my degree, but I am still unsure of the exact field I want to work in. I hope to gain more clarity on the specific career I want throughout my time at UCSD and in Theta Tau! ",
      "TT": "Personally, Theta Tau has given me a supportive and loving community at UCSD which I couldn't have ever predicted. The Brothers are not only my close friends, but also people I look up to professionally. Whether I am looking for someone to confide in or someone to help me with interview prep, I can always rely on the community in Theta Tau. ",
      "Favorite Memory": "I've made many core memories with Theta Tau, but if I had to choose a favorite then it would be when we went to Beyond Wonderland together. It was the first music festival that I went to with brothers and, needless to say, it brought us all a lot closer. ",

      "Favorite Memory": "My favorite memory in Theta Tau would have to be this past year's formal.

      "Career": "After graduation, I aspire to work in a big city as a data analyst or business intelligence analyst. I find that the process of combing through raw datasets and making sense of them is very rewarding - especially if it you are exploring a topic of interest. I've changed my mind numerous times regarding my career choice but I think that becoming a data analyst would be a step in the right direction. Goals can always change though, so it's important to be adaptable. ",
      "TT": "Personally, most of my friends have come from Theta Tau. I think that when people hear the term \"professional\" attached to any organization, they imagine that the members treat each other like coworkers. However, some of my closest friends have come from Theta Tau.  \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, I can always ask people about which classes I should take, what professors they recommend, or if they could help me prepare for an interview/polish my resume. Theta Tau is a great resource to have and the advice comes from people who are interning/working at great companies.",
      "Favorite Memory": "Honestly my favorite memories are when I go into Geisel and there is always someone I can talk to, study, or get food with. I know it's not exactly the most exciting thing in the world, but I feel like those are the moments I will look back on fondly when I am done with college. It's the little things in life. ",
      "Interests": "My favorite hobby is easily weight lifting. I used to love playing basketball, but I got really into weightlifting the summer between freshman and sophomore year. I think the process of bodybuilding is very rewarding and obviously it's great for your health. This year I might try getting into powerlifting more. \n\nOutside of the gym, I love following sports, particularly basketball and American football. I am a lifelong Patriots fan even though I was born in Los Angeles. The reason is because my childhood best friend got me into football and his family is from New England. Once we went to a Patriots game and met Tom Brady's dad - he let us wear one of Tom's rings and it was definitely a memorable moment in my life. ",
