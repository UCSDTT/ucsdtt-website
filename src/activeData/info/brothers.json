My inspiration for project management stems from my passion to work with people while maintaining both my technical and business expertise. Being able to communicate effectively and empower stakeholder engagement is my day-to-day job and Theta Tau has helped me gain more confidence in doing so. ",
    "TT": "Theta Tau has provided me the social environment necessary to develop my soft skills. Coming in as an engineer, it was a skillset that I lacked and needed guidance. In additional to the professional development, Theta Tau has supported my ambitions to grow in my field of expertise and become more confident in working with stakeholders. Theta Tau was both a professional organization but also a second family where I can be myself around. ",
    "Favorite Memory": "Theta Tau Regionals and large events were my highlights of being in Theta Tau. Seeing many of us together was always an enjoyable experience. ",
    "Interests": "In my undergrad, I came in as a Mechanical Engineering major and developed interest in product design and project management, with the later being my primary focus. Currently I'm working at Northrop Grumman as a project manager for the F-35 program. As for my personal interest, I really enjoy large music festivals and am a big yelper myself so I find most of my weekends to be discovering new options on yelp or reviewed by food critics. ",

It's become a tight-knit group of friends who support each other. We work on homework and Leetcode together! But it's not all about academics and professional development.

    "Favorite Memory": "It's a little hard to recall one specific memory because all the fun times and good vibes sort of mesh together into a collection of smaller memorable moments. I always enjoy spontaneous cooking nights, late night adventures, and honestly any time that I spend together with my Brothers.",
    "Interests": "I was born in New York and came to San Diego for the first time for college! Some things I enjoy are painting, volleyball, and table tennis, although I'm not the best artist or athlete. I always love trying new things and potentially finding new hobbies regardless.",

    "Favorite Memory": "I've made many core memories with Theta Tau, but if I had to choose a favorite then it would be when we went to Beyond Wonderland together. It was the first music festival that I went to with brothers and, needless to say, it brought us all a lot closer. ",

    "Favorite Memory": "My favorite memory in Theta Tau would have to be this past year's formal.

I find that the process of combing through raw datasets and making sense of them is very rewarding - especially if it you are exploring a topic of interest. I've changed my mind numerous times regarding my career choice but I think that becoming a data analyst would be a step in the right direction. Goals can always change though, so it's important to be adaptable. ",
    "TT": "Personally, most of my friends have come from Theta Tau. I think that when people hear the term \"professional\" attached to any organization, they imagine that the members treat each other like coworkers. However, some of my closest friends have come from Theta Tau.  \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, I can always ask people about which classes I should take, what professors they recommend, or if they could help me prepare for an interview/polish my resume. Theta Tau is a great resource to have and the advice comes from people who are interning/working at great companies.",
    "Favorite Memory": "Honestly my favorite memories are when I go into Geisel and there is always someone I can talk to, study, or get food with. I know it's not exactly the most exciting thing in the world, but I feel like those are the moments I will look back on fondly when I am done with college. It's the little things in life. ",
    "Interests": "My favorite hobby is easily weight lifting. I used to love playing basketball, but I got really into weightlifting the summer between freshman and sophomore year. I think the process of bodybuilding is very rewarding and obviously it's great for your health. This year I might try getting into powerlifting more. \n\nOutside of the gym, I love following sports, particularly basketball and American football. I am a lifelong Patriots fan even though I was born in Los Angeles. The reason is because my childhood best friend got me into football and his family is from New England. Once we went to a Patriots game and met Tom Brady's dad - he let us wear one of Tom's rings and it was definitely a memorable moment in my life. ",
