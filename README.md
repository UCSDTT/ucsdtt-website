# UCSD Theta Tau Chapter Website Redesign
Welcome to the README file of the UCSD Theta Tau Chapter Website Redesign repository. This project aims to address the issues with the [original website](https://github.com/UCSDTT/ucsdtt-website), which was created in 2018. Over time, the website's layout and content have become outdated, resulting in user dissatisfaction and performance concerns. Our goal with this new website redesign is to improve the overall user experience and create a visually appealing, modern, and user-friendly website.

## Project Overview
The UCSD Theta Tau Chapter Website Redesign project focuses on revamping the existing website to meet current web design standards and implement features requested by users. This repository serves as the central hub for the project's source code and design processes.

## Key Objectives
- Modern Web Design: We recognize the need to update the website's visual aesthetics and ensure it aligns with contemporary design principles and trends.

- Improved User Experience: By addressing the issues raised by users, we aim to enhance the website's usability, navigation, and overall user satisfaction.

- Performance Optimization: We understand the importance of speed and responsiveness. Our redesign will incorporate optimizations to deliver a faster and smoother browsing experience.

## User Research
Before initiating the redesign process, we conducted thorough user research to gain insights into the existing website's strengths, weaknesses, and user expectations. The research included surveys with current and potential users of the UCSD Theta Tau Chapter website.

### Key Findings:

1. Outdated Design: Users expressed dissatisfaction with the website's outdated design, which made it feel less professional and visually unappealing.

2. Navigation Issues: Several users reported difficulties in finding specific information or navigating through different sections of the website.

3. Mobile Responsiveness: The original website lacked optimal responsiveness on mobile devices, leading to a subpar user experience for a significant portion of the user base.

4. Content Relevance: Users expressed a desire for more up-to-date and relevant content, including event updates, news, and resources related to the UCSD Theta Tau Chapter.
